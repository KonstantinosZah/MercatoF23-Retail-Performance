Mercato F23 – Retail Sales Performance & Customer Insights (Power BI)

This project analyzes multi-year retail sales performance for Mercato F23, a fictional department store, using the Tableau Sample Superstore dataset adapted for portfolio use.

The dashboard explores sales growth, profitability, product mix, geographic performance, customer value, and seasonal patterns, with a focus on identifying structural risks and performance drivers rather than short-term fluctuations.

The report is built in Power BI, using a clean star-schema data model, DAX measures, and executive-oriented visual storytelling.

Executive Summary

Objective

Assess overall retail performance across products, customers, and regions to identify growth patterns, profitability risks, and stable seasonality signals that support informed commercial decision-making.

Key Findings

The business demonstrates strong and sustained growth, with increasing sales and customer activity over time.

Profitability remains positive overall, but margin pressure indicates that revenue growth does not always translate into proportional profit gains.

Growth is primarily volume-driven, as order counts expand faster than average order value.

Performance varies widely across products, customers, and regions, with pockets of negative profitability highlighting pricing, discounting, and mix inefficiencies.

Seasonal demand patterns are stable and repeatable, with consistent year-end strength and early-year softness, providing a reliable baseline for planning.

Dashboard Overview

The dashboard is organized into the following analytical sections:

Executive Overview
High-level KPIs, multi-year trends, and category margin context, supported by an integrated executive summary.

Product Details
Sales and profitability analysis by category and sub-category, highlighting loss-making items, margin dispersion, and product mix imbalances.

Geography
Regional, state, and city-level performance, revealing uneven profitability across locations and identifying structurally underperforming areas.

Customer Details
Customer value and concentration analysis, including profitability dispersion and dependency on top customers.

Trends & Seasonality
Long-term sales trends and recurring seasonal patterns, separating structural growth from predictable demand cycles.
